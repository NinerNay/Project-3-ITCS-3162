        "#Introduction\n",
        "The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various physical and locational characteristics of residential properties. This is a part of a Kaggle competition, House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. The competition provides a dataset describing nearly 1,500 homes in Ames, Iowa, each with 79 explanatory variables such as lot size, year built, overall material quality, and neighborhood. By applying a series of regression models, from simple linear regression to more advanced ensemble methods, we aim to uncover the hidden patterns that drive housing prices. The project ultimately demonstrates how statistical modeling and machine learning can extract insight from real-world data and support better, data-driven decision-making in housing markets."
